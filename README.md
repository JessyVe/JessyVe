I guess right now you are holding some kind of device in your hand or at least have a screen with thousands of pixels in front of you. How I know that? Well, I do believe that most people usually do not print out readmes before they look at them. Instead, it is all here in your pocket. Yet not just here, about almost everywhere technology plays its part nowadays. As someone passionately working with software everyday it is like a giant candy shop of different flavours and opportunities!
